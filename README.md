#### What is it? ####
A collection of some programs under competetive programming competitions like *Hackerrank, CodeChef, SpoJ* etc.

----


#### Your code has poor documentation ####
This repository has working programs that were submitted during competitions as it is. 
As such they lack comments and proper documentation. However, you can use it as follows.

* Say, you want to look for sieve of eratosthenes's code snippet. Just search in the repo.
* If you want the implementation of the range min-max segment tree, just search segment-tree
* File names usually correspond to the problem title they refer to. So you can search by that.

#### Who is this for ####
Budding programmers delving into the world of competitive programming wanting to see the code in action.

#### Why is it even here ####
I like to share and showcase all facets of my professional career. Competetive programming is something I extensively did
during my college days and I still give it a try whenever time permits.

As such this is a subtle reminder of my capabilites. I'd encourage others to do the same.
